# Uber-Bookings-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Uber booking data to gain insights into ride trends, customer demand, and overall business performance using Power BI. The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and key metrics were created using DAX to measure total bookings, revenue, trip distance, cancellation rate, and average trip value.
